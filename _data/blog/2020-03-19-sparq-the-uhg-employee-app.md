Connected. Informed. Inspired. Those are the guiding principles that led this project from day one. Connecting  UHG employees to one another irregardless of the line of business they worked under. Informing them with news from leadership and around the world. Inspiring them to step forward with empathy and wisdom.

Sparq allows employees to securely carry critical aspects of their workday on their phone. The feature set is aimed at striking a balance between functionality that makes life easier and enriching content that nurtures the employee as a person.
